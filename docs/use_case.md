# Use Case: Rapid Patient Overview in Emergency Consultations

## Scenario

Imagine you're on a series of blind dates—except each date lasts only 15 minutes, and each person comes in complaining of abdominal pain. You need to decide: Is this nothing serious or an emergency requiring immediate hospital care?

This situation captures the daily reality of doctors in emergency consultation clinics:

- They see patients for the first time, often with ambiguous symptoms.
- They have minimal time to figure out what’s wrong.
- They typically lack a complete background on the patient’s lifestyle, past visits, or medical history.

## The Challenge

Without ready access to the patient’s medical records—or time to sift through them—even highly skilled doctors can struggle. For instance:

- A patient who frequently visits doctors for minor complaints might be at less risk of a serious condition.
- Another patient, who rarely seeks medical help, may only show up when a condition is severe.

Knowing these nuances can vastly change how a doctor addresses the patient’s symptoms and communicates next steps.

## The Solution: **“💚 Consultation Warm Up 💚”**

To solve this challenge, we created *Consultation Warm Up*, an application that:

1. **Retrieves patient records quickly** (with the patient’s consent) to provide:
   - A short, easy-to-read summary of the patient’s lifestyle, medical history, and known conditions.
   - A comprehensive report if deeper insight is required.
2. **Enables quick Q&A** via a built-in conversational AI interface. Doctors can ask specific follow-up questions about the patient’s history—like medication details, lab results, or relevant lifestyle factors—without sifting through pages of notes.
3. **Promotes effective communication** by allowing doctors to adapt their approach based on personal and medical contexts, thus improving patient care.

### Key Benefits

- **Rapid Preparation**: Doctors can get a “warm up” overview of the patient’s medical past, saving valuable time in high-pressure consultation scenarios.
- **Targeted Interventions**: Having quick access to recurring patterns (e.g., frequent minor complaints or rare but severe issues) helps tailor the consultation.
- **Better Patient Experience**: The patient feels heard and acknowledged, as doctors can reference personal details without the patient repeating them endlessly.

### How It Works in Practice

1. **Patient Consent**: The patient consents to share medical records from their digital platform (e.g., Doctolib).
2. **Data Retrieval**: The app fetches a summary of relevant medical history—lab results, visit frequency, diagnoses, etc.
3. **Report Generation**: A concise overview is automatically generated (and a more in-depth version is optional).
4. **AI-Powered Q&A**: The doctor can ask targeted questions (e.g., “Are they on any chronic medication?”) using the built-in chat interface.

> By making patient data quickly digestible, *Consultation Warm Up* empowers emergency healthcare providers to diagnose and communicate more effectively under time constraints.

**In short, *Consultation Warm Up* helps break the “blind date” barrier between a physician and a new patient by providing swift, AI-assisted insight into their health background—leading to more informed decisions and better patient outcomes.**
