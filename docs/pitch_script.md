> The other person says they have abdominal pain and asks for your help. Do you brush it off as a simple stomach ache, or do you rush them to the hospital?
> [pause]
> **Now imagine you have back-to-back 15-minute “blind dates”**—everyone tells you something is wrong, and you only have a few minutes to decide what to do.

> That’s exactly the daily challenge for doctors in emergency consultations in France: they see new patients with ambiguous symptoms under serious time pressure. Because they lack detailed background information, it’s often hard to figure out the most crucial next step.

> **Now suppose the patient gives consent** to pull their Doctolib records. Great—but there might be dozens of files, and sifting through them all in a few minutes is impossible. Critical details about their habits or medical history could be missed—like whether they’re a frequent visitor for minor issues or someone who only shows up for severe problems.

> **Imagine if the doctor knew** this person’s likely behavioral patterns—Health-Conscious, Non-Adherent, Risk-Taker, Hypochondriac, or Health Optimizer. They could adapt their communication, build a stronger connection, and make more informed decisions—leading to better patient outcomes.

> **That’s why we built “💚 Consultation Warm Up 💚.”** It breaks the “blind date” barrier by providing quick, AI-powered insights into a patient’s health history—shifting the interaction from a cold ❄ to a warm approach 💚, improving both consultation experiences and results.
