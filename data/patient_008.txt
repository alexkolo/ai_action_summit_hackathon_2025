Clinical Reports
1. Neurologist Consultation Report
Date: February 1, 2025
Findings:

Neurological exam: Normal cranial nerve function, no motor or sensory deficits.
Visual field exam: No permanent deficits, normal between episodes.
Trigger patterns identified: Migraines triggered by bright light, stress, and sleep deprivation.
Impression:

Migraine with aura.
No evidence of structural abnormalities or secondary causes.
Plan:

Start prophylactic migraine medication (Topiramate 25 mg nightly, titrate to 50 mg as tolerated).
Continue acute treatment with Sumatriptan 50 mg as needed during migraine episodes.
2. MRI Brain Report
Date: January 25, 2025
Findings:

No evidence of intracranial mass or lesion.
No acute infarcts or structural abnormalities.
Normal parenchymal and vascular structures.
Impression:

Normal MRI, ruling out secondary causes of headaches and visual disturbances.
3. Vision Assessment Report (Ophthalmology)
Date: January 22, 2025
Findings:

Visual acuity: 20/20 (both eyes).
Retinal exam: Normal, no evidence of detachment or vascular abnormalities.
Visual disturbances attributed to migraine aura.
Impression:

No ocular pathology.
Aura symptoms likely due to cortical spreading depression associated with migraines.
4. Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (CMP)
Date: January 18, 2025

Test	Result	Reference Range
Sodium	140 mmol/L	135–145 mmol/L
Potassium	4.1 mmol/L	3.5–5.0 mmol/L
Blood Glucose (Fasting)	89 mg/dL	70–99 mg/dL
ALT	25 U/L	7–56 U/L
AST	18 U/L	10–40 U/L
Impression:

Normal metabolic panel.
Plan and Recommendations:
Migraine Management:

Prophylactic Therapy: Start Topiramate 25 mg nightly, increase to 50 mg after 2 weeks if tolerated.
Acute Treatment: Prescribe Sumatriptan 50 mg; patient to take at onset of migraine. Avoid exceeding 2 doses per 24 hours.
Lifestyle Modifications:

Maintain regular sleep patterns (consistent bedtime and wake-up time).
Reduce screen time and take regular breaks from digital devices.
Avoid known triggers (bright lights, prolonged fasting, and stress).
Incorporate stress-reducing activities (e.g., yoga, meditation, or regular exercise).
Dietary Guidance:

Avoid migraine-triggering foods (chocolate, processed meats, red wine, etc.).
Stay hydrated by consuming at least 2 liters of water daily.
Follow-Up:

Neurology follow-up in 3 months to assess response to Topiramate and frequency of migraines.
Repeat visual assessment if aura symptoms worsen or change in pattern.
Patient Education:

Educate the patient about aura symptoms and their benign nature in the absence of neurological deficits.
Reinforce the importance of taking Sumatriptan early during migraines to optimize efficacy.
