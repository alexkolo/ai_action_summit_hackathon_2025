Clinical Reports
1. Bone Density Scan (DEXA)
Date: January 12, 2025
Findings:

Lumbar Spine T-Score: -3.2 (severe osteoporosis).
Left Femoral Neck T-Score: -2.7 (osteoporosis).
Impression:

Advanced osteoporosis with high fracture risk.
2. MRI of Lumbar Spine
Date: January 25, 2025
Findings:

L4-L5 disc herniation compressing the left sciatic nerve.
Moderate lumbar spondylosis and facet joint arthritis.
No evidence of metastatic lesions or acute vertebral fractures.
Impression:

Sciatica due to L4-L5 disc herniation.
3. X-Ray Thoracic Spine
Date: January 20, 2025
Findings:

Evidence of old compression fractures in T6 and T7 vertebrae.
Mild thoracic kyphosis.
Impression:

Chronic compression fractures secondary to osteoporosis.
4. Vitamin D and Calcium Levels
Date: January 15, 2025

Test	Result	Reference Range
Vitamin D (25-OH)	22 ng/mL	30–100 ng/mL
Serum Calcium	9.2 mg/dL	8.5–10.5 mg/dL
Impression:

Vitamin D insufficiency.
Plan and Recommendations:
Osteoporosis Management:

Continue Alendronate 70 mg weekly.
Increase Vitamin D supplementation to 2000 IU daily.
Maintain calcium intake of 1200 mg daily through diet and supplements.
Recommend light weight-bearing exercises and physical therapy to improve bone strength and mobility.
Fall prevention measures: Remove tripping hazards, install grab bars in the home, and ensure proper footwear.
Sciatica Treatment:

Prescribe Gabapentin 100 mg at night, titrate to 300 mg daily as tolerated, to manage nerve pain.
Refer to physical therapy for lumbar stabilization exercises and sciatica-specific stretches.
Consider epidural steroid injection at L4-L5 if pain persists despite conservative measures.
Pain Management:

Use Acetaminophen 1000 mg up to 3 times daily as needed for mild pain.
Avoid NSAIDs due to increased fracture risk and potential gastrointestinal side effects.
Consider referral to a pain specialist if pain is refractory to current treatment.
Vitamin D Replenishment:

Recheck Vitamin D levels in 3 months after starting high-dose supplementation.
Lifestyle Adjustments:

Encourage short daily walks with assistance as tolerated to maintain mobility.
Emphasize the importance of hydration and a balanced diet rich in leafy greens and dairy for bone health.
Follow-Up:

Bone density scan (DEXA) in 12 months to monitor progress.
Follow-up with neurology in 6 weeks to assess response to Gabapentin and physical therapy for sciatica.
Patient Education:
Explain the chronic nature of sciatica and the importance of adhering to physical therapy for long-term relief.
Educate on osteoporosis and fracture prevention strategies, emphasizing fall avoidance.
Discuss the role of Vitamin D and calcium in improving bone health and reducing future fractures.
