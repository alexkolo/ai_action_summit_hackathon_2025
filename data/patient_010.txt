Diagnostic Reports
Blood Tests:

HbA1c: 9.6% (poorly controlled).

Lipid Panel:

Total Cholesterol: 250 mg/dL

LDL: 160 mg/dL

HDL: 35 mg/dL

Renal Function:

Creatinine: 2.1 mg/dL (elevated)

eGFR: 38 mL/min/1.73m² (CKD Stage 3b).

Urinalysis:

Proteinuria: 3+ (confirmed 24-hour urine collection: 2.8 g/day).

Microalbuminuria: Positive.

Imaging:

Retinal Imaging: Moderate non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy with macular edema.

Renal Ultrasound: Bilateral small, echogenic kidneys consistent with chronic kidney disease.

ECG: Sinus rhythm, left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) noted.

Assessment
Uncontrolled Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus with complications:

Diabetic Retinopathy (non-proliferative with macular edema).

Diabetic Nephropathy (CKD Stage 3b).

Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy.

Hypertension: Poorly controlled.

Obesity: BMI 32.5.

Plan
Diabetes Management:

Switch to Insulin Degludec (long-acting) + Insulin Aspart (prandial) for tighter glucose control.

Start Empagliflozin 10 mg daily (SGLT2 inhibitor for renal protection).

Discontinue Metformin (eGFR <45 contraindication).

Hypertension:

Add Amlodipine 5 mg daily to Lisinopril.

Goal BP <130/80 mmHg.

Vision:

Urgent referral to ophthalmology for anti-VEGF therapy (e.g., aflibercept) for macular edema.

Renal Protection:

Low-protein diet (refer to renal dietitian).

Monitor electrolytes and eGFR monthly.

Lifestyle Interventions:

Structured diabetes education program.

Weight loss counseling (goal: 5% body weight reduction).

Smoking cessation reinforcement.

Follow-Up:

Repeat HbA1c in 3 months.

Podiatry referral for foot care (neuropathy prevention).

Nephrology consult for CKD management.
