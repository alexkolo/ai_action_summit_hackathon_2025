## App Description

A Streamlit application that simulates a patient lookup and medical record analysis workflow. The app demonstrates how to:

1. Look up a patient's medical records by a given identifier (e.g., Social Security Number).
2. Obtain patient consent for searching and analyzing medical records.
3. Generate a comprehensive medical report from a backend and using the Mistral API.
4. Provide a question-and-answer interface using a Mistral LLM to further query the report.

### Features

- **Patient Lookup**: Checks if a patient exists (mocked in this example).
- **Consent Workflow**: User must explicitly confirm that patient consent has been provided to continue.
- **Comprehensive Report Generation**: Uses either a mock function or a Mistral model to generate a summary and final report.
- **Interactive Q&A**: Embeds a chat interface allowing users to ask follow-up questions about the patientâ€™s medical history, with the option to download the chat transcript.
- **Report Download**: Allows you to download the generated medical report as a text file.
